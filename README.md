# ðŸ˜ŽðŸ“š made for myself - study purposes
### What you'll encounter:  
Basically, this is a personal repository, which I use to test, study and run my own codes.  
What I have here, are files type:
- **Python**<sup>primarily</sup>
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **C**/**C++**
- **Swift**

And even, some .xlsx files due to some of my .py projects.
